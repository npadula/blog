A list of online courses that I did, am doing, or would like to do sometime. Courses listed here can follow a structured/formal approach (they can have excercises like courses on Pluralsight and Coursera) or just be a simple collection of Youtube lectures.

## Frontend

### React
- _(Done)_ [Corey House's React/Redux on Pluralsight](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-redux-react-router-es6/table-of-contents). Very useful for understanding the Flux architecture and how Redux implements it.
- _(Done)_ [Daniel Stern's Redux-Saga](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/redux-saga/table-of-contents). Good complement to the Redux course, also a good resource to understand generators in ES6.

### Angular
- _(Doing)_ [Angular Fundamentals by Jim Cooper](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/angular-fundamentals/table-of-contents). Good for an overall picture of how Angular works. Longer than usual but that is to be expected because Angular itself it's a broader framework than React, Vue, and others.

## Machine Learning

- Andrew Ng's Machine Learning.
- Yaser Abu-Mostafa's Learning From Data
- Stanford CS229
- NYU Deep Learning

## Software Architecture / System Design
- _(90% Done)_ [Pluralsight's Domain-Driven Design Path.](https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skill/domain-driven-design). Amazing series of courses, it covers many aspects like Clean Architecture, theoretical DDD concepts, implementation of DDD to application design and refactoring, combination with CQRS and Event Sourcing, and some other patterns. Recently they added [Vladimir Khorikov's latest EF Core course](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/ddd-ef-core-preserving-encapsulation/table-of-contents), which seems really promising too.

## Blockchain
- _(Done)_ [Ivan Mushketyk's Ethereum Development course](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/ethereum-blockchain-developing-applications/table-of-contents). It's a very good course because it provides a good, broad picture of how blockchain architectures work, as well as a more in depth look of how to implement DApps with Solidity.

## Mathematics
- Measure Theory
- Category Theory
