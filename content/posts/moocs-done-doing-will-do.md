A list of online courses that I did, am doing, or would like to do sometime. Courses listed here can follow a structured/formal approach (they can have excercises like courses on Pluralsight and Coursera) or just be a simple collection of Youtube lectures.

## Frontend

### React
- _(Done)_ [Corey House's React/Redux on Pluralsight](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-redux-react-router-es6/table-of-contents). Very useful for understanding the Flux architecture and how Redux implements it.
- _(Done)_ [Daniel Stern's Redux-Saga](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/redux-saga/table-of-contents). Good complement to the Redux course, also a good resource to understand generators in ES6.

### Angular
- _(Done)_ [Angular Fundamentals by Jim Cooper](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/angular-fundamentals/table-of-contents). Good for an overall picture of how Angular works. Longer than usual but that is to be expected because Angular itself it's a broader framework than React, Vue, and others. Very comprehensive, you get a look at all the main constructs in Angular.

## Machine Learning

- _(Dropped out)_ Andrew Ng's Machine Learning (Coursera). Pretty good, intuitive course, I dropped out after the neural networks unit because it felt a little bit shallow, and I wanted some more details on the underlying math.
- _(Done)_ [Yaser Abu-Mostafa's Learning From Data](https://work.caltech.edu/telecourse). One of the best courses I've ever watched both online and IRL. The lectures are engaging and provide tremendous insight on the fundamental learning problems. Highly recommended.
- _(Dropped out)_ [Stanford CS229](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU). Started this one after Lelarning From Data. Since it is Stanford I thought it would be a more deep version of Andrew Ng's Coursera MOOC, but I was severely dissappointed. I feel not much math insight is gained from the lectures, and classes are kind of boring. The lecture notes are handy though.
- [NYU Deep Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bMe_vCZo30&list=PLLHTzKZzVU9eaEyErdV26ikyolxOsz6mq). Focused on Deep Learning, so it's more narrow than CS229. Seems to have a lot practical lessons so that is cool.
- [fast.ai](http://fast.ai) has a lot of stuff, more practiced oriented.

## Software Architecture / System Design
- _(Done)_ [Pluralsight's Domain-Driven Design Path.](https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skill/domain-driven-design). Amazing series of courses, it covers many aspects like Clean Architecture, theoretical DDD concepts, implementation of DDD to application design and refactoring, combination with CQRS and Event Sourcing, and some other patterns. Recently they added [Vladimir Khorikov's latest EF Core course](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/ddd-ef-core-preserving-encapsulation/table-of-contents), which seems really promising too.

## Distributed Systems
There are many in this category that I want to do:

- [MIT 6.824](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrw6a1wE39_tb2fErI4-WkMbsvGQk9_UB) is **entirely available for free**, with [auto-grading scripts](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/index.html) and everything!
- [Lambda Architecture](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/spark-kafka-cassandra-applying-lambda-architecture/table-of-contents) seems to have a pretty good overview of a widely used big data architecture.
- _(Doing, ~80%)_ [Scaling Applications with Microservices, MassTransit and RabbitMQ](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/masstransit-rabbitmq-scaling-microservices/table-of-contents) is more about queues and events than anything else, but the last units do seem to provide explanations of common patterns.
- [Microservices Architectural Design Patterns Playbook](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/microservices-architectural-design-patterns-playbook/table-of-contents) seems to be more of a reference than anything, but it may be worth a shot.


## DevOps
- There are several k8s courses that I want do so to familiarize myself with some internal aspects. Pluralsight have two paths, the [developer path](https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skill/using-kubernetes-as-a-developer) content seems interesting as an overview, but I'm also interested on networking and monitoring, which is covered in the [administration path](https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skill/kubernetes-administration).

## Functional Programming
- _(Done)_ [Applying Functional Principles in C#](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/csharp-applying-functional-principles/table-of-contents). Good intro to useful patterns in C#. 

- [Functional Programming in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/scala). Taught by the Scala creator himself. Appears to have several practical application lectures. Seems really promising.

## Blockchain
- _(Done)_ [Ivan Mushketyk's Ethereum Development course](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/ethereum-blockchain-developing-applications/table-of-contents). It's a very good course because it provides a good, broad picture of how blockchain architectures work, as well as a more in depth look of how to implement DApps with Solidity.

## Mathematics
- [Measure Theory](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBh2i93oe2qvMVqAzsX1Kuv6-4fjazZ8j). No reason for this, just looks pretty cool.
- [Category Theory](https://www.youtube.com/user/DrBartosz/playlists). Kind of scared of this one, been a while since I worked in stuff so abstract.
