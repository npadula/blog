As a programmer, I deal with abstractions for work on a daily basis. As an obsessive abstractionist, I also deal with them the rest of the day. Here is a collection of ramblings about said abstractions (and some other things too). Sometimes in English, sometimes in Spanish.

## Things you can find here

* Math, technology and other technical topics
* Philosophy, human behavior and life in general
* Fictional and not so fictional stories
* Unsolicited opinions about music, film, literature, and other sorts of media
* Links to content that has spiked my attention in one way or another
