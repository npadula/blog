As a [programmer](https://npadula.com), I deal with abstractions for work on a daily basis. As an overall nerd, I also deal with them for fun during the rest of the day. Here is a collection of thoughts on those subjects and some others. Sometimes in Spanish, sometimes in English.

## Things you can find here

* Math, technology and other technical topics
* Philosophy, human behavior and life in general
* Fictional and not so fictional stories
* Unsolicited opinions about music, film, literature, and other sorts of media
* Links to content that has spiked my attention in one way or another
