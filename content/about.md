My name is Nico and I'm a software developer living in Argentina. I am also a part-time Information Systems Engineering student. When I'm not working or studying, I still nerd out on technology and math, but also philosophy, psychology and other abstractions. 

This is certainly not the first iteration of having my own online space, but I sort of want to maintain it uncluttered. This is why I went for a fresh start. Hopefully I'll be sharing some of the stuff I learn, and my own thoughts and projects too.
