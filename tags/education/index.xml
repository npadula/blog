Courses listed here can follow a structured/formal approach (they can have excercises like courses on Pluralsight and Coursera) or just be a simple collection of Youtube lectures.
Frontend React (Done) Corey House&amp;rsquo;s React/Redux on Pluralsight. Very useful for understanding the Flux architecture and how Redux implements it. (Done) Daniel Stern&amp;rsquo;s Redux-Saga. Good complement to the Redux course, also a good resource to understand generators in ES6.</description></item></channel></rss>
