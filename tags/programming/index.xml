By using Visitor, we can create new behavior that acts upon certain entities, without placing that behavior on the entities themselves.
For example, consider serialization: what is better? entity.serialize() or serializer.serialize(entity) ? I&amp;rsquo;d say that the second option is preferable because we may want to implement a complex serialization process with several dependencies that don&amp;rsquo;t really relate to the entity itself.</description></item><item><title>Foundations &amp; Intuition: Programming and Music</title><link>https://npadula.com/blog/posts/foundations-intuition-programming-music/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://npadula.com/blog/posts/foundations-intuition-programming-music/</guid><description>Fair warning: Probably none of what I&amp;rsquo;m going to say below is new or original.
Music and Missing Fundamentals As a teenager, with the primary goal of becoming cool in mind, I decided to learn how to play the bass. I bought a bass, downloaded For Whom the Bell Tolls' tabs, and started practicing. Fast forward a couple of years and I could sort-of-play more interesting songs, but, eventually, while learning tabs and practicing technique was fun, I started noticing limitations, which eventually (among other factors), led me to stop playing.</description></item></channel></rss>
